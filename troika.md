## meta magic
originally imagined for 'longshot city' and 'academies of the arcane', this compatible with Troika! role-playing game, or other games with magic.  
has not been playtested.

### advanced skill
'meta magic'
You have deeper understanding of how magic works on a very foundational level.

#### training and learning
**Prerequisites**  
PC must possess knowledge of an opposite magical advanced skills pair (f.e. Secret Signs 'Enlightenment' and 'Occult') at rank 3 or higher. 

**Process**  
During 'getting better', if both opposite advanced skills were exercised, roll under Luck (without spending Luck).   
If successful, PC gets an insight into the very fabric of magic - add 'meta magic' advanced skill at Rank 1, add 1 random meta magic spell.  
Further advancing works as usual.  
Alternative: ancient tome/scroll, magician capable of meta magic and willing to teach you. Prerequisites must be fulfilled.

**Spells mechanics**  
Meta magic spells enhance your next non-meta magic casted spell.  
Cost is equal to power number plus delta(Δ) between highest and lowest ranked opposite advanced magical skills.  
Meta magic rank cannot exceed other advanced magical skills.  
Each additional rank unlocks random unknown meta magic spell.  
Once all meta magic spells known, each next rank allows to prepare +1 meta magic spell. 
Once rank 10 is reached, each rank allows to prepare +1 meta magic spell within single turn.
(?)Once rank 15 is reached, each rank allows to apply +1 meta magic spell to a meta magic spell.
