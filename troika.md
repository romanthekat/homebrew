### advanced skill
'meta magic'  
You have deeper understanding of how magic works on a very foundational level.

#### training and learning
**Prerequisites**  
PC must possess knowledge of an opposite magical advanced skills pair (f.e. Secret Signs 'Enlightenment' and 'Occult') at rank 3 or higher. 

**Process**  
During 'getting better', if both opposite advanced skills were exercised, roll under Luck (without spending Luck).   
If successful, PC gets an insight into the very fabric of magic - add 'meta magic' advanced skill at Rank 1, add 1 random meta magic spell.  
Further advancing works as usual.  
Alternative: ancient tome/scroll, magician capable of meta magic and willing to teach you. Prerequisites must be fulfilled.

**Spells mechanics**  
Meta magic spells enhance your next non-meta magic casted spell.  
Cost is equal to power number plus delta(Δ) between highest and lowest ranked opposite advanced magical skills.  
Each additional rank unlocks random unknown meta magic spell.  
Meta magic spell can be cast together with 1 other spell within a turn.
Once all meta magic spells known, each next rank allows to cast +1 meta magic spell within a turn. 
Once rank 2 is reached, each rank allows to cast +1 meta magic spell within single turn. So that up to 2 spells at rank 2, up to 3 spells at rank 3, etc.
(?) Once rank 3 is reached, each rank allows to apply a meta magic spell to a meta magic spell.  
Meta magic rank cannot exceed other advanced magical skills.
